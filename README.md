# Hello-World-K
OS lab
The cake is a lie, but Ï€ is always true
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense
Half-ghost, half-human, and half-baked
Take it easy!
Everybody, Everybody!

So long, and thanks for all the fish
So sad it had to come to this
We tried to warn you all, but oh dear~

You may not share our intellect
Which may explain your disrespect
For all the natural wonders that grow around you~
So long, so long and thanks, for all the fish.

If I could have one last wish, I would like a tasty fish
If I could have one last thing, I would like some lungs to sing.
Come, one and all
Man, and mammal
Side, by side in life's great gene pool!

So long, so long, so long, so long,
So long, so long, so long, so long,
So long, so long and thanks, for all the fish!
